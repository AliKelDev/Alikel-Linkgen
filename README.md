## Installation & Configuration

(Unless you want to modify the way something works, using the deployed version is recommended: [https://linkforge-alikeldev.netlify.app/dashboard](https://linkforge-alikeldev.netlify.app/dashboard))

### Prerequisites

-   **Node.js:** Version recommended by the `.nvmrc` file (Requires Node.js 18+). Check with `node -v`.
-   **npm:** Comes with Node.js. Check with `npm -v`.
-   **Git:** For cloning the repository.
-   **(Optional) Gemini API Key:** Required *only* if you intend to run the application locally and use the Kei AI assistant. Needed for the Netlify Function to work.

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AliKelDev/Alikel-Linkgen.git
cd Alikel-Linkgen

# Install recommended Node.js version (if you use nvm)
nvm use

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables for local development (only needed for AI)
cp .env.example .env
# Edit the .env file in the project root:
# Add your Google Gemini API key like this:
# GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Start the development server (usually runs on http://localhost:3000)
npm run dev

# To build for production
npm run build
```

### Environment Variables

-   `.env` file (in project root):
    -   `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Your API key for Google Gemini. This allows the `ai-chat.js` Netlify function (or its local development equivalent) to communicate with the AI model. *Note: Using the API may incur costs based on usage.*

### Adding New Features

#### New Role Type

1.  Add the new role key to `ROLES` and its configuration to `ROLE_CONFIGS` in `src/contexts/RoleContext.jsx`.
2.  Create a corresponding link generation utility file in `src/utils/linkUtils/`.
3.  Update UI components (like `RoleSelector.jsx`, potentially `BulkLinkGenerator.jsx`) to recognize and handle the new role.
4.  Define the specific link types for the new role in `BulkLinkGenerator.jsx` (inside `ROLE_LINK_TYPES`).

#### New Search Template (within an existing role)

1.  Add a new link generation function (e.g., `generateNewTypeLink`) in the relevant role file within `src/utils/linkUtils/`.
2.  Update the `generateLinks` function in that same file to include the new type.
3.  Add the new link type and label to the `ROLE_LINK_TYPES` constant in `BulkLinkGenerator.jsx`.
4.  Ensure `GeneratedLinkCard.jsx` can display the new link type correctly (it should work automatically if the structure is consistent).
5.  Add a corresponding "Open All..." button in `BulkLinkGenerator.jsx`.

## Advanced Usage Tips

### Market Segmentation Research

Use the **Company Bucket Selector** to estimate sizes for a list of companies, then export the results (which include the bucket classification) for market analysis or territory planning.

### Conference Preparation

1.  Input companies attending an event into the **Bulk Link Generator**.
2.  Generate links for key roles (e.g., Sales Leaders, Tech Leaders).
3.  Use the **Domain Checker** to quickly find their main websites.
4.  Use **Kei AI Assistant** to get quick summaries or potential talking points for each company.

### Competitive Analysis

1.  Input competitors into the **Bulk Link Generator**.
2.  Use the **Domain Checker** (especially the grid view) to analyze their web presence and branding consistency across TLDs.
3.  Generate links for key departments (e.g., Sales, Engineering) to map their organizational structure.
4.  Ask **Kei** to compare their likely strategies or tech stacks based on available information.

## What's Next

Planned improvements include:

-   Ability for Kei to remember user-specific information across sessions (like preferred prompts, user's role, company, etc.) similar to profile creation.
-   Exploring more advanced AI capabilities for Kei, potentially analysis of broader market trends or more specific profile analysis (maybe image analysis via Moondream if feasible).
-   Adding more specific search templates based on user needs.
-   Potentially exploring more agentic functions for Kei to perform multi-step tasks.
